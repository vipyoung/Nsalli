Offline prayer timetable for London

I needed this app when I first relocated to London. 
All I needed is to have a simple app/page on my mobile phone that tells me the time of different prayers. 
Of course, I didn't want to install all those famous faith apps that track your usage and behavior, and share/sell data with thrid-parties.

The solution was to download the year-long prayer's time table for the city of London and deploy it as a PWA. 
I also decided to try hosting it on Github pages
